# Usage
The script requires the installation of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). [Learn more about ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/)
Also, please ensure, that the path in line 2 in the script matches with the installation directory of the Android SDK on your computer.
Furthermore, there is a USB connection of your Android device to your PC required.

# Legal disclosure
I don't have the rights of the game 2048 or the logo of the game.
